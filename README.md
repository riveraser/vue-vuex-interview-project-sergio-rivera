## Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to create a demo RESTful application using Golang.

### The Task

In this task, we are building the backend of a team application that helps us manage the resources in each project.

#### Features and Requirements

1. A resource will be either a contractor or an employee.
2. A resource can have a few different tags like C#, Angular, General Frontend, Seasoned Leader and so on.
3. A resource has a role, for instance: Software Engineer, Project Manager and so on
4. We should be able to use the same tag for multiple resources

We need to offer endpoints that allow us to create/read/update/delete all the information related.

#### Notes:

1. You can use any Golang framework
2. Make sure to provide a tutorial on how to run your application
3. Feel free to use any database
4. Make sure to use a migration system for the database

#### Bonus points:

1. If you add automated tests
2. If you provide a Docker image
